# DGL-104-ProcessPortfolio

## Week-1

### 0101
<p>I was trying to study React early on. I was going through the lifecycle method componentDidUpdate but I was facing an issue. That was that every time I updated the state, the method would run, but it would run indefinitely.Now that I look at it I reckon passing in the previous state and using a simple if statement to check if the previous state and current state are different, would help solve the problem.Another method would be to use Hooks and pass in the array of the state that needs checking.
</p>

### 0102
<p>In CPS-100 we were usually asked to write the pseudo code in comments and then build on our code. I found it a bit undesirable to do so, but failing to add comments would cost me marks so I used to just add them at the end.But this would in return be grounds for another problem- readability. I got into the habit of writing comments that were too descriptive. Thanks to eclipseâ€™s format feature I was able to indent my code just by using ctrl+shift+f. I could also use appropriate descriptive names. </p>

## Week-2

### 0202
<p>Considering the React project I was working on, they weren't qutie descriptive.</p>
<p>The following are the changes I would like to make in them
Changing name of the following variables and methods:</p>

  - from d to date
  - from n to name
  - from uploadinglist to setList
  - from get_user_data_to_state to getUserData
  - from changingthestate to handleChange
  
<p>I reckon using proper variable names would be quite helpful in the long run.Reading the code after a long time,I couldn't understand what the words d and n represented. If at all I were to send my code to some other developer I might have to put in the extra hardwork document what each word meant</p>


### 0203
<p>I found the kata to be quite simple. It barely took me a minute to figure out the logic. Although I had to spend a couple on debugging.</p>
