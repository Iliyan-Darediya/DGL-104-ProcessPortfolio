## Week-1

### 0101
<p>I was trying to study React early on. I was going through the lifecycle method componentDidUpdate but I was facing an issue. That was that every time I updated the state, the method would run, but it would run indefinitely.Now that I look at it I reckon passing in the previous state and using a simple if statement to check if the previous state and current state are different, would help solve the problem.Another method would be to use Hooks and pass in the array of the state that needs checking.
</p>

### 0102
<p>In CPS-100 we were usually asked to write the pseudo code in comments and then build on our code. I found it a bit undesirable to do so, but failing to add comments would cost me marks so I used to just add them at the end.But this would in return be grounds for another problem- readability. I got into the habit of writing comments that were too descriptive. Thanks to eclipseâ€™s format feature I was able to indent my code just by using ctrl+shift+f. I could also use appropriate descriptive names. </p>

## Week-2

### 0202
<p>Considering the React project I was working on, they weren't qutie descriptive.</p>
<p>The following are the changes I would like to make in them
Changing name of the following variables and methods:</p>

  - from d to date
  - from n to name
  - from uploadinglist to setList
  - from get_user_data_to_state to getUserData
  - from changingthestate to handleChange
  
<p>I reckon using proper variable names would be quite helpful in the long run.Reading the code after a long time,I couldn't understand what the words d and n represented. If at all I were to send my code to some other developer I might have to put in the extra hardwork document what each word meant</p>


### 0203
<p>I found the kata to be quite simple. It barely took me a minute to figure out the logic. Although I had to spend a couple on debugging.</p>

## Week-3

### 0301

<p>The app that I choose for comparison is Instagram. I tried to find screenshots of it on an IOS device, but I couldn't. So I'm comparing its android interface with the web interface.</p>
<p>The key differnces I found are as follows</p>

  -  The app on android covers larger width by percentage,than the web does.
  -  The header section of the web app consists of the app name, a search bar and a log in details section.
  -  The header section of the android app only has the back option and the more option in its header
  -  The web app doesn't display the new reels feature, whereas the mobile app does.
  -  Hovering over the posts on the web app gives us the number of likes and comments on a particular post, long Pressing the post on the mobile app doesn't give us this option

### 0302

The document I choose is <a href = "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi">Apple Music.</a> 
<p>The documentation was short and consise. It showed how the key;tokens and response ; request are handled. It also provided details on how we can find a particular album, artist or song. It also talked about the playlist feature. It provide an insight in terms of music genres and ratings. The musicKit Js article was a related article, it talked about how to use applemusic in our own application </p>

## Week-4

This is the pattern that I chose.
<p>The reson I choose this pattern is because I feel that this pattern has a subtle navigation layout throught. It has a certain way of its management in terms of graphics and spacing. This pattern can be well used by users who prefer the one-hand use option. I believe that all the elements in this pattern are well responsive </p>
